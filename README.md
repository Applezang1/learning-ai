# learning-ai
A collection of **AI-based** implementations organized by sub-categories. The implementations are based on coding exercises in "Understanding Deep Learning" by Simon J.D. Prince.

## Repository Format 
### Subcategories
The **subcategories** in this repository include: 
- Convolutional Networks 
- Deep Neural Networks 
- Fitting Models 
- Gradients and Initialization 
- Loss Functions 
- Measuring Performance
- Pre-Requisite Mathematics  
- Regularization 
- Shallow Neural Networks 
- Supervised Learning 
- Transformers  

### Subfolders 
#### Summaries
Each subcategory contains a summary of topic, written in a markdown file. 

#### Code 
Each subcategory contains a subfolder called 'Code'. The subfolder contains Python code demonstrating a function prevalent in the subcategory. 

#### Jupyter Notebooks
Each subcategory also contains a subfolder called 'Jupyter Notebooks'. The subfolder contains Jupyter notebooks, which provides a detailed explanation of the code.
