# Comparison between Learning Models
## Types of Machine Learning Methods: Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement learning 
### Supervised learning: 
**<ins>Supervised learning</ins>**: Supervised learning models are a type of learning model that maps specific input values to output values. 

#### Learning Mechanism: 

1. A supervised learning model learns how to map specific input values to output values by using a training dataset with known relationships between input and output

2. The model makes its own predictions with the given input values and computes the loss function between its predicted output value and the actual output value

3. The model then updates its parameters to minimize the loss function, allowing the model to better fit the known relationship

<ins>Example</ins>: A model that predicts house prices given properties about the house 

<ins>Strengths</ins>: Because supervised learning models are given a training dataset with known relationships between input and output values, they allow the model to achieve high accuracy. 

<ins>Weakness</ins>: Supervised learning models require large training datasets to perform well, which are difficult to obtain

### Unsupervised Learning
**<ins>Unsupervised model</ins>**: Unsupervised learning models are a type of learning model that learns to find specific patterns in input data

#### Learning Mechanism:  

1. Unsupervised learning models learn how to find patterns in input data through loss functions, where each unsupervised learning model is unique due to their internal loss function.

2. The within-cluster sum of squares is an example of a loss function that certain types of unsupervised learning models use

3. This loss function measures how close each data point is to the cluster. 

4. The parameters are updated to move the cluster closer to its neighboring data points

<ins>Example</ins>: Grouping pixels that illustrate the same object  

<ins>Strengths</ins>: Unsupervised learning models don’t require training datasets to learn and interpret input data 

<ins>Weaknesses</ins>: The lack of a training dataset makes it difficult to validate whether the loss function correctly optimizes the parameters, and external validation methods need to be used to check the accuracy of the output

### Reinforcement Learning
**<ins>Reinforcement Learning</ins>**: Reinforcement learning models are a type of learning model that learns decision-making strategies in a given environment  

#### Learning Mechanism: 

1. Reinforcement learning models are given a set of actions, which are randomly chosen at first 

2. The model either receives a reward or a punishment based on its actions 

3. Based on the output from its actions, the model updates its policy (learned action plan) to optimize its rewards

<ins>Example</ins>: A model that learns how to play chess 

<ins>Strengths</ins>: The model doesn’t require any training dataset and can use its own previous actions to train and optimize its parameters 

<ins>Weaknesses</ins>: The model can run into the exploration-exploitation trade-off, where a sufficient reward keeps the model from experimenting to possibly increase its reward.
